## Home Manager Configuration

This is my attempt to setup my Ubuntu machine via home-manager. This mostly just work in progress and i'm using the `nix-channel` approach vs the preferred flakes approach. It's OK, it's for me to learn and eventually i will move to a more sophisticated approach, this is just a start.
